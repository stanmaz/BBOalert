Shortcut,w_w, We are Sonny and Thorvald and play Strong !C (Precito); but open lighter than most \n1!C is 17+ hcp if BAL or 14+ hcp (or equivalent) if non-BAL; Most positive hands (6)7+ hcp respond 1!D - this is NOT GF\n1!D is 0+!D - (9)10-12(13-) bal or 10-13 5!C+4 any or 5+!D + 4 major or any 4441)\n1!H/!S=5+-card and following rule of 18; and normally less than 14 hcp\n1NT = 13+-16 "bal"-ish; 5-card major included \n2!C=6+!C 9-13 hcp and 2!D=5+!D unbal 9-13 hcp; no major so either 6+!D or 4+!C\n2N=55+ without !C - below opening range\nLeads vs. suit 3./5. vs NT 2./4. with attitude. Ace asking for attitude. King for count (UDCA). Queen for attitude.\nWe grade hands a lot - semi bal with points in the long suits tend to be treated as unbalanced; with points in the short suits treated as balanced\n Honors in long suits will be upgraded and for balanced hands we mostly follow hcp-count\nHCP is a guide - actually a VERY bad guide - and certainly not a prescription\nTactical bids outside length and range agreements might occur\n, width=34% backgroundColor=greenyellow
